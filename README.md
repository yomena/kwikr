## Install
Make sure you have NodeJs installed. Bower and Gulp have to be installed globally. If you don't have them already run:

```bash
npm install -g gulp bower
```

Now run the folowing commands from the desired directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yomena/kwikr.git
```
```bash
cd kwikr
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
bower install
```

```bash
gulp
```

That's it! kwikr is installed.

Run ```gulp watch``` to automatically build on every file change or ```gulp``` to rebuild the entire project.
